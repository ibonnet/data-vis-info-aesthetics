# Visualize Quantities, Categories, and Summarized Data

### Description

Similar to your working process last week, use SVG in an Observable notebook to create a rough prototype of an "alternate" view of time. You may not use a linear timeline or a calendar-based view. But any non-conventional expression of "time" (choose any unit(s) of time and any abstraction to represent it). The more "out there," the better; your abstraction should be more "Picasso" than Bob Ross. Your representation should make clear what the time represents and how to interpret it, but everything else is on the table. 

prompts: clock, calendar, timeline, reminders, nagging, spacetime, circadian rhythm, alarms, sundials, the light of the sun, lateness, travel time, bells, overtime, apps, planners, Alexa, pets, playing hooky, time travel, being stoned, the state of ‘flow’, solitary confinement, ‘wine o’clock’, wormholes, trauma, music/rhythm, “me” time, the time of your life

### Answer

Every time he arrives home, Warren washes his hands seven times. He is not scared of contracting COVID-19, but he can still feel the filth from the years that he spent in solitary confinement. Warren was allowed to take only one 10-minute shower a week. Three years later, his hygiene became excessive and he considers himself a germaphobe.

Warren washes his hands as he arrives home. “When you don’t feel good inside, you don’t feel good outside,” he said. “Prison is so dirty that I just feel like I have an accumulation of dirt.”

Studies show that the inhumane conditions of solitary confinement lead to catastrophic effects on people's mental health. Despite effort to change the laws to ban long-term solitary confinement in New York, every other day, about nine percent of incarcerated people in the State are still locked by themselves in a cell. They can spend months or even years in a cell, deprived of any social interaction.

I used SVG to recreate days, hours and minutes of the week that people can spend in solitary confinement without being allowed to take a shower. The yellow lines represent the 10 minutes that Warren spent in the shower. The code can be found here: https://observablehq.com/@ibonnet/solitary-confinement/2

## Prototype Visualization

### Description
	
Through documentation, imagery, sketches, and/or any other means of expression, submit a single document that articulates your design prototype for the AA data we are working with in Data Structures. You should address the following issues:

1. functionality

2. divs/components

3. adherence to a grid system (for both desktop and mobile)
