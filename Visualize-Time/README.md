# Exercise 1: Visualize Time

## Expressing Time

### Description

Select a data visualization that you feel does a good job at expressing TIME. Post a url to access that visualization, and write a short paragraph on why you selected it. In addition, you must respond to at least one other of your peers' submissions. 

### Answer

"Conflict Urbanism: Colombia" is a project created by the Center for Spatial Research that explores data movements in Colombia since 1985. This animation goes through time showing the different lines of migration paths that Colombians did over the years, which is representative of the growing violence inside the country. The website also allows users to select a municipality, the date, gender, race, actor and events that are related to this migration. I am one of the millions of Venezuelans who were forced to flee the country because of the growing insecurity and repression in the country. Venezuela used to be a home for Colombian refugees, and is now the main nationality crossing the borders with Colombia, which hosts most of the diaspora. I really like this animation because it shows well the path that Colombians did over time to leave the cities, and on itself illustrate different events that were happening in the country.

## Bertin's graphic system

### Description

Use Bertin’s ‘graphic system’ to analyze/define the time based data visualization you posted to Canvas last week. Write a brief summary to articulate the strengths and weaknesses of Bertin’s system.


### Answer

Based on Bertin's graphic system, here is how I interpret the visual I chose:

1. The scope of the graphic system: The visual variables which are available are different locations in time where people went to inside Colombia. The map on its own over time represents what Bertin says as "They form a world of images." In this case, the movements form multiple lines in different directions inside Colombia. Although Bertin says that "in signifying space any visual variable appears as meaningful," I believe that it this visualization the movements of people only become meaningful when put together and analyzed over time. They are not necessarily meaningful when they stand alone.

2. The length of the visual variables: Homogeneous dimension of the lines to represent the movements inside Colombia. This map uses a rectilinear elevation.

3. The levels of organization of the visual variables: I believe that what fits in this category are the multiple colors used for the movements inside the country as well as for each different category to better  understand the profile of each individual: gender, race, event, etc. We can easily perceive the difference in movements over time. Color is not indispensable in this visualization either, because the addition of lines over time can also show that some movements are more frequent in certain areas than in others. 

## Using SVG

### Description
Use  SVG in Observable (particularly circle, line, and rect elements) to create a ROUGH sketch of the time based data visualization you analyzed with Bertin’s system and posted to Canvas last week. The expectation is a “stick figure” version, showing the core “marks” (points, lines, and areas) of the visualization. You may also incorporate visual variables and/or axes/labels, but this is not expected. 

To get started, here is the code from our SVG exercises in class: https://observablehq.com/@aaronxhill/basicsvgLinks to an external site. 

### Answer

I've included all variables and numbers as we did last week, but the graph do not appear on the page. I am wondering whether this has something to do with the scale of the graph? What would be a good way to fix this so the scale can go from 1985 to 2015, and from 1,767 to 7,260,022?
