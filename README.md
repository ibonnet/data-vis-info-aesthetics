<b>Project: </b> Every time he arrives home, Warren washes his hands seven times. He is not scared of contracting COVID-19, but he can still feel the filth from the years that he spent in solitary confinement. Warren was allowed to take only one 10-minute shower a week. Three years later, his hygiene became excessive and he considers himself a germaphobe.

Warren washes his hands as he arrives home. “When you don’t feel good inside, you don’t feel good outside,” he said. “Prison is so dirty that I just feel like I have an accumulation of dirt.”

Studies show that the inhumane conditions of solitary confinement lead to catastrophic effects on people's mental health. Despite effort to change the laws to ban long-term solitary confinement in New York, every other day, about nine percent of incarcerated people in the State are still locked by themselves in a cell. They can spend months or even years in a cell, deprived of any social interaction.

I used SVG to recreate days, hours and minutes of the week that people can spend in solitary confinement without being allowed to take a shower. The yellow lines represent the 10 minutes that Warren spent in the shower. The code can be found here: https://observablehq.com/@ibonnet/solitary-confinement/2
